The source code included is old and may need some tweaks to be compiled with latest versions of components.

It was originally made with Delphi 7.

Additional components you need:
- RemObjects Pascal Script - http://www.remobjects.com
- VirtualTreeView - http://www.delphi-gems.com/VirtualTreeview/


Also installer files are old and have not been changed, so they will not work with latest NSIS version.

Subtitle Workshop is released under the GNU/GPL 3 license. The About Window needs updating to reflect this fact.
